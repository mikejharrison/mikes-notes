At the end of January, we held the TDSIG Webcarnival. This is a video discussing an oops moment – those moments where things don't go so well – and what I learnt from it.

The event itself didn't go off without a hiccup – the connection was too bad for one of the four speakers – but we still had a really interesting day discussing moments where things go wrong and what it's possible to learn about teaching when the wheels fall off.

You can read more about the speakers on the [IATEFL Teacher Development SIG website](http://tdsig.org/webcarnival/).
